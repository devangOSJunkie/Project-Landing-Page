# Project: Landing-Page
Aim: The goal here is to create an entire webpage from a design provided by the Odin Project.

Experience: This project helped me improve my flexbox concepts and positioning. I got to know about flexbox indepth it was hard or me to visualize it earlier but this project provided a good hands-on experience.
            Now I feel comfortable positioning different elements on the webpage and moving them in general using the flexbox concepts.
            I learnt how the elements are laid on the webpage and the different types to display them like block and flex.
            Got good experience about margin,paddding and different styling properties.
            Targeting elements,Grouping them.
            Use of nested containers to have more control over the positioning.
            learnt about 100vh for the header and footer.
